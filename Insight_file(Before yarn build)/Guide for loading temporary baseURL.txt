Temporary Front-End solution so you can test if your API integration is working:
Click on window -> type run and hit enter -> in the command window copy:

chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

This will open a new "Chrome" window where you can work easily. This is a temporary solution. Every time you will have to work with this chrome window.
